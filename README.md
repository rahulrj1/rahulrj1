# Hey 👋 I’m Rahul

Software Engineer (Backend) with 2.5+ years of experience 

I build **reliable backend systems**, **automation-first platforms**, and occasionally **LLM-powered tools** that ship to production.  
I care about **clean system design**, **ownership**, and **writing code that scales without drama**.
